This adapter connects ioBroker to various Dyson Air Purifiers.

Fan-Icon in Logo created by [Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/de/autoren/freepik) from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/de/).

### supported devices

* Dyson Pure Cool Link Tower (TP02, ProductType 475)
* Dyson Pure Cool Tower, 2018 model (TP04, ProductType 438)
* Dyson Pure Cool Link Desk (DP01, ProductType 469)
* Dyson Pure Cool Desk, 2018 model (DP04, ProductType 520)
* Dyson Pure Hot+Cool Link (HP02, ProductType 455)
* 2018 Dyson Pure Hot+Cool (HP04, ProductType 527)
* Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool (PH01, ProductType 358)

## Features

Connects your Dyson fans, fan heaters, air purifiers, and air humidifiers to ioBroker.

* Reads values from devices and sensors
* Can control devices by giving you the ability to change some values (main power, oscillation, heating, fan speed, ...)
* Reads device list from Dyson servers

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* This adapter needs Node.js >= version 10
* To get this adapter running you'll need a Dyson account.
* Make sure to add your fan to your account. Either via App or online.

### Adapter installation

#### Using npm

Run ```npm install ioBroker.dysonairpurifier``` on your ioBroker installation to grab the latest version of this adapter from the npm repository.

#### Alternative: Using GitHub URL

Install through the ioBroker Admin UI by pointing it to the latest stable release on GitHub:
<https://github.com/Grizzelbee/ioBroker.dysonairpurifier/tarball/master/>

You can also install older release versions using this methods (by pointing to a version tag, e.g., ```v0.6.0``` instead of ```master```in the URL), but the most recent one is generally preferred.

### Config-data needed

* Dyson account username
* Dyson account password (this adapter can handle passwords up to 32 characters)
* your fans/air purifiers IP address in your LAN.

*Please note*: Due to early development state and a non conform mDNS implementation by Dyson you'll need to provide the local IP of the device *after the first run*.

> On the first start of this adapter the Dyson API is queried for all your devices and all supported devices will be created in the devicetree -- with their basic information provided by the API and an additional field "Hostaddress".
>
> So please run the adapter once and your Dyson devices will be created in the device tree with their basic settings.
>
> Then stop the adapter, enter the IP(s) into the Hostaddress field(s) and restart the adapter. After that your Dyson devices in the device tree should be populated with data.
