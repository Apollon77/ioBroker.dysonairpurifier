## Features

## Installation
Install from STABLE or LATEST repository or from github - depending what stability you prefer.

### Prerequisites
* To get this adapter running you'll need a dyson account.
* Make sure to add your fan to your account. Either via App or online.

### Config-data needed
* dyson account username
* dyson account password
* your ISO-Country code (DE, US, CA, ...). This will mostly be the country you opened your dyson account in.
* your fans/air purifiers IP address in your LAN.
Due to early development state and a non conform mDNS implementation by dyson you'll need to provide the local fans IP after the first run.
On the first start of this adapter the dyson API is queried for all your devices and all supported devices will be created in the devicetree - with it's basic information provided by the API and an additional field "Hostaddress".
So please run the adapter and your air purifiers get created in the devicetree with their basic information. 
Then stop the adapter, place the IP into field Hostaddress and restart the adapter. After that all your air purifiers should get populated. 

## Changelog
### Todo:
* detect IP of devices automatically
* Add more country codes
* remove deprecated library crypto
* test with more different devices
* collect more mqtt message acronym meanings
* calculate filter life in % not in hours

### known issues:
 * No automatic IP detection of devices
